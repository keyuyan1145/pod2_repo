# 1. Convert a temperature of 100 degrees fahrenheit to celsius
celsius_100 = (100 -32) * 5/9
print('100 fahrenheit =', celsius_100, 'celsius')
# The variable celsius_100 has a math equation to convert 100 F in C.
# First I subtracted 32 from 100 and put that into () and multiplied the result by 5/9

# 2. Convert a temperature of 0 degrees fahrenheit to celsius
celsius_0 = (0 - 32) * 5/9
print('100 fahrenheit =', celsius_0, 'celsius')
# The variable celsius_0 has a math equation to convert 0 F in C.
# First I subtracted 32 from 0 and put that into () and multiplied the result by 5/9

# 3. Convert a temperature of 34.2 degrees fahrenheit to celsius
print((34.2 - 32) * 5/9, "celsius")
# I created a print statement contain a formula to convert 34.2 F into C.
# First I subtracted 32 from 34.2 and put that into () and multiplied the result by 5/9

# 4. Convert a temperature of 5 degrees celsius to fahrenheit?
print(5 * 9/5 + 32, 'fahrenheit')
# First I multipled the 5 by 9/5 and added 32 to it inorder to convert to F.

# 5. What is hotter, a temperature of 30.2 degrees celsius, or a temperature of 85.1 degrees fahrenheit?
print('30.2 celsius =', 30.2 * 9/5 + 32, 'fahrenheit')
celsius30 = 30.2 * 9/5 + 32 
print('30.2 C is hotter than 85.1 F ')
print(celsius30 > 85.1)

# I converted 30.2 C into Farenheit
# Then I made a variable called celsius30 for the equation.
# Then I outputed a boolean confirming celcius30 > 85.1
